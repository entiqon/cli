## âœ¨ Added

### Core Features
- **CLI Toolkit Extraction**
    - `cli/` folder has been split from the `entiqon` monorepo into its own repository: `github.com/entiqon/cli`.
    - Establishes a dedicated home for Entiqonâ€™s developer and DevOps automation utilities.

- **Git & Release Automation**
    - `gcpr`: create GitHub PRs quickly.
    - `gce`: extract commits for changelogs.
    - `gcr`: generate releases with notes.
    - `gct`: manage signed tags.
    - `gsux`: safe stash utilities.
    - `gcch`: changelog regeneration.
    - `ddc`: deploy Docker containers.

- **Testing & Coverage**
    - `gotestx`: custom test runner with consolidated coverage output.
    - `run-tests.sh` and `open-coverage.sh`: helpers to streamline local and CI testing.
    - CI/CD integration with enforced **minimum 80% coverage** and Codecov reporting.

- **Documentation Helpers**
    - Scripts for changelog generation and release note preparation.
    - Support for semantic versioning and structured commit history.

### Purpose
The Entiqon CLI bridges the gap between **library development** (`db`, `common`) and **release management**, providing automation for testing, Git workflows, tagging, and lifecycle management.
